In my lab, we have several soft pneumatic robots that we use for reasearch. The embedded pressure control system on several of them started to fail, so I (with some help from some labmates) created a low cost and (soon-to-be) open-source pressure control module. I'm working on writing a paper for it and once that's done I'll release the designs. 

The complete system can daisy chain for any number of pressure controlled joints and also provides a ROS interface. So once this is connected to a local network, you can run it from any computer.

Here's a few pictures of the PCB I designed to provide high-rate control for up to 4 pressure chambers:

Autodesk also provides a nice online 3d viewer where you can look all around at the PCB. [Here's the link.](https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2bfa3a4/g/shares/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd968397a0c1512b8fb2d).
