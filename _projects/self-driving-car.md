This project was a semester long project for Dr. D.J. Lee's course on Autonomous Vehicles. The [code](https://github.com/curtiscjohnson/self-driving-cars) for this project is on my GitHub. Our challenge was to autonomously navigate a mini city, recognize and respond to signs, stop at rail road crossings, and stay on the road. We used a combination of computer vision, controls, and reinforcement learning to accomplish this task. Here's a video of our final result:
