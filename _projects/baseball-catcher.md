Here's a video of a project that Daniel Cheney and I worked on together. We used stereo vision to track baseballs thrown from a pitching machine in real-time and programmed a catching gantry to move and catch the ball. 

The major challenge was that the balls were thrown at approximately 30 mph, which left us only about 400 ms to detect the ball, track it, predict its trajectory, and move to intercept it. 

We accomplished 17/20 catches with 3 close rim hits.
