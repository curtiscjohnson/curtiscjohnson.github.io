I recently defended (and passed!--thankfully) my PhD research proposal entitiled "Modeling, Planning, and Control for Whole-Body Manipulation of Unknown Objects with Large-Scale Soft Robots". The proposal is a document that outlines the research I plan to do for my PhD. It includes a literature review, a description of the problem I'm trying to solve, and a description of the research I plan to do to solve the problem. 

Here are my presentation slides:
