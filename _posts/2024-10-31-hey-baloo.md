As part of my PhD research, I’ve designed and built a soft robotic torso we call Baloo. We dressed it up as a pirate for Halloween this year!

To celebrate Laboween with the BYU Robotics and Dynamics Laboratory, I set up a fun interactive demo using [OpenAI’s Whisper speech recognition model](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3)! 

Visitors can talk to Baloo and get some candy!
