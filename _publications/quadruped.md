abstract: "Legged robots have the potential to cover terrain not accessible to wheel-based robots and vehicles. This makes them better suited to perform tasks such as search and rescue in real-world unstructured environments. In addition, pneumatically-actuated, compliant robots may be more suited than their rigid counterparts to real-world unstructured environments with humans where unintentional contact or impact may occur. In this work, we define design metrics for legged robots that evaluate their ability to traverse unstructured terrain, carry payloads, find stable footholds, and move in desired directions. These metrics are demonstrated and validated in a multi-objective design optimization of 10 variables for a 16 degree of freedom, pneumatically actuated, continuum joint quadruped. We also present and validate approximations to preserve numerical tractability for any similar high degree of freedom optimization problem. Finally, we show that the design trends uncovered by our optimization hold in two hardware experiments using robot legs with continuum joints that are built based on the optimization results."
