I'm a PhD student working with [Dr. Marc Killpack](https://www.me.byu.edu/directory/marc-killpack) in the Robotics and Dynamics Laboratory at Brigham Young University. My research interests lie at the intersection of model predictive control, adaptive control, and machine learning -- specifically applied to soft or compliant robots. My PhD work is focused on [modeling, planning, and control for whole body manipulation with soft robots](/_posts/2022-10-24-prospectus-defense.md). I'm developing control and planning algorithms for autonomous whole-body manipulation of objects that cannot be grasped with an end effector.

I'm incorporating onboard feedback like [tactile sensing](/_projects/tactile-sensing.md), vision, and [pressure sensing](/_projects/pneudrive.md) which are crucial for these algorithms to work. While algorithms and intelligence are exciting, I also enjoy working with hardware -- I believe the field of robotics is best served by working with both. I've been building a [soft robotic torso](/_projects/whole-body-manipulation.md) equipped with distributed tactile sensors to test out the [whole body manipulation algorithms](/_projects/mujoco-simulation.md) I'm developing. 

I'm excited for opportunities to develop robots of any shape or size that augment human capabilites and improve quality of life.
