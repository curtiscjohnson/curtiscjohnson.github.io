I'm a PhD student working with Dr. Marc Killpack in the Robotics and Dynamics Laboratory at Brigham Young University. My research interests lie at the intersection of model predictive control, adaptive control, and machine learning -- specifically applied to soft robotics. Soft robots have the potential to completely change how humans work with robots and how robots interact with their environments. They also exhibit challenges which I find particularly interesting, such as underactuation, novel actuators and sensors, and control while in contact with the environment. While soft robots are not the answer in every scenario, I believe that they are a fantastic test bed for understanding the control of any system in the real world, where the ability to reason about uncertainty, leverage data, adapt to surroundings, and make future predictions is key.
